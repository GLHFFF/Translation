    "question1": "What's the ApeX protocol?",
    "answer1": "#ApeX protocol\n\nApeX protocol is a decentralized and non-custodial derivatives protocol that facilitates the creation of perpetual swap markets for any token pair. Users can trade crypto derivatives directly on the Ethereum blockchain without any intermediaries. The ApeX protocol offers unlimited flexibility as users can create markets on any underlying asset while maintaining control of their private keys.\n\n#ApeX Vision\n\nApeX empowers traders around the world with open and transparent financial tools that can help preserve and grow their wealth. It aims to drive financial inclusion and make crypto derivatives trading more accessible.\n\n#ApeX Features\n\n1. Permissionless perpetual contract trading with leverage\n2. Elastic automated market maker (eAMM)\n3. Protocol controlled value (PCV)\n\nTo learn more about ApeX, please refer to the GitBook.",
    "question2": "What's an elastic automated market maker (eAMM)?",
    "answer2": "The ApeX protocol operates on an elastic automated market maker (eAMM) model with the “constant product” formula as the core of price discovery. The eAMM provides a spot-like trading experience and significantly improves capital efficiency. It allows single-asset provision as the base asset while synthesizing the quote asset.",
    "question3": "What's protocol controlled value (PCV)?",
    "answer3": "The protocol controlled value (PCV) model aims to solve the \"mercenary capital\" issue facing most DeFi protocols. In a PCV model, assets locked on smart contracts are ultimately owned by the protocol and not redeemable by users. This approach guarantees the liquidity of each perpetual contract market, while ensuring that no liquidity provider can pull out the protocol-owned liquidity. For more information on the PCV model, please refer to <a href=\"https://docs.apex.exchange/apex/price-pegging#protocol-controlled-value\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #1890FF; text-decoration: underline;\">gitbook</a>.",
    "question5": "What's the funding fee on the ApeX protocol and how's it settled?",
    "answer5": "To peg the spot prices on the ApeX protocol with the index prices on other DEX, funding will be exchanged directly between those who hold long and short positions. Given that the funding of all positions cannot be settled directly on the chain, the cumulative premium fraction (CPF) is used for real-time funding settlement.<br/>\nCPF will be updated each time a user adjusts his/her positions, and the funding fees depend on his/her current position size as well as the differences between the latest CPF and the CPF when the adjustment was made. The funding fees of all other position holders will also be adjusted accordingly.",
    "question6": "How's the liquidation price on the ApeX protocol derived?",

    "question8": "What's the debt ratio?",

    "question9": "When will liquidation be triggered?",
    "answer9": "If the value of your collateral falls below the maintenance margin, liquidation may be triggered on your account. In most cases, the liquidation price fluctuates based on the risk exposure and leverage adopted by each user. The larger the position, the higher the maintenance margin.\n<br/>\nTo minimize liquidation risk, you may close a position before the liquidation price is triggered, choose a lower leverage, and/or append margin to move the liquidation price further away from the current market price.",
    "question10": "What's slippage?",
    "answer10": "Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is filled. It depends on the pool size of the selected pair and the order value. On the ApeX protocol, a user can customize his/her slippage tolerance.",

    "question20": "What's a reduce-only order?",

    "answer32": "For security purposes, the ApeX protocol will limit the max. amount of liquidity a user can remove. The ratio between the net position (quote token) and the pool liquidity (quote token) will be used to prevent the failed closure of a user's open position due to a rapid change in liquidity. The ratio, which is 0.1 by default, serves to mitigate the impact when a large order has been placed and/or a large net position has been opened.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the number of long position deviates significantly from the number of short positions, the max. amount of liquidity a user can remove will be lower. Alternatively, if the number of long and short positions is well balanced and the net position value is zero, all liquidity can be removed by the user.",
